# SQL

## Project Overview

The project uses a dataset named `s_india`, which appears to contain information such as:
- **State-wise and year-wise records**
- **Total number of reported cases**
- **Breakdown by gender and age group**
- **Type of su###de**

Through SQL, I performed a variety of operations to understand the distribution, trends, and patterns in the data.

## SQL Concepts Practiced

- Basic `SELECT` queries
- `WHERE` clause filtering
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` for aggregations
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, etc.
- Sorting using `ORDER BY` and limiting with `LIMIT`
- Subqueries
- Data cleaning (`DELETE WHERE` conditions)
